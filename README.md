# 🔐 Random Password Generator

This is a beginner-friendly **Python-based Random Password Generator** that creates secure passwords using alphabets (both cases), numbers, and special characters — based on a user-defined length.

✅ Built as part of my learning journey towards **AI Development**, this project focuses on improving logic-building and core Python skills.
