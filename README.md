#  Random Password Generator

This is a beginner-friendly **Python-based Random Password Generator** that creates secure passwords using alphabets (both cases), numbers, and special characters — based on a user-defined length.

✅ Built as part of my learning journey towards **AI Development**, this project focuses on improving logic-building and core Python skills.

##  Features

- User-defined password length (**minimum 8 characters**)
- Character distribution:
  - 50% Alphabets (randomly mixed case)
  - 30% Numbers
  - 20% Special Characters
- Characters are shuffled for randomness
- Easy-to-read and well-commented code

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module
- `math` module

##  Sample Output

```bash
Enter Password Length: 12
Generated Password: hG@9d7P&c5e!
```
